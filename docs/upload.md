## Example data

For local testing you can quickly upload some of the example compendia using a Docker image that is part of the [o2r-bagtainers](https://github.com/o2r-project/o2r-bagtainers) project.
The following command executes the container and uploads 7 empty examples and two selected bagtainers to a server running at the Docker host IP.

```bash
docker run --rm o2rproject/examplecompendia -c <my cookie> -e 7 -b 0003 -b 0004 -b 0005
```

For more configuration details, see the project's README file.
