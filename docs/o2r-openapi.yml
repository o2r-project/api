    ## About

    The o2r web API acts as the interface between the [o2r](https://o2r.info) [microservices](https://o2r.info/architecture/) and the [web interface](https://github.com/o2r-project/o2r-platform).

    The API provides services around the executable research compendium (ERC), or "compendium" for short, which is documented [in the ERC spec](https://o2r.info/erc-spec/).

    **A good starting point for understanding the different parts of the API is the [compendium life-cycle](#compendium-lifecycle).**
    The API is implemented as a [REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer)ful API. The entrypoint for the current version is /api/v1.
    Unless specified otherwise, responses are always in JSON format. Body parameters in `POST` requests are expected in `multipart/form-data format.` Requests to the API should always be made with a secure connection using  `HTTPS`. Some requests require [authentication](#section/User-authentication) with a specific [user level](#section/User-levels).

    ### Load test & performance

    To evaluate the performance of the o2r web API in realistic usage scenarios, the o2r team developed a scripts that simulates concurrent creation and interaction with ERCs.
    See <https://o2r.info/api/evaluation/load_test.html> for details.

    ### Compendium lifecycle

    An authorized user (see [user levels](#section/User-levels)) can create compendia from different sources, i.e. [direct API upload](#operation/upload_compendium) or [via a public share](#).
    The uploaded workspace is then treated as a [candidate compendium](#section/Candidate-process) until all required [metadata](#tag/Metadata) is provided.
    A candidate must be [saved](#section/Candidate-process) to become publicly available, and then may not become a candidate again.
    A published compendium can be [executed](#tag/Execution) and the whole compendium can be [shipped](#tag/Shipment) to repositories for preservation purposes.
    A user can combine data and workflow of multiple compendia with [substitution](#tag/#operation/upload_substitution).

    [Specific users](#section/User-levels) can (i) create [public links](#tag/#operation/upload_link) for candidates so these can be inspected by third parties without logging in, and (ii) manage [users](#tag/Users)).

    The API provides a generic [search](../search.md) endpoint for finding compendia and jobs and uses [ORCID and OAuth for authentication](#section/User-authentication).

      summary: Upload via API
      description: |
        Upload a research workspace or full compendium as a compressed `.zip` archive with an HTTP `POST` request using `multipart/form-data`.

        The upload is only allowed for logged in users. Upon successful extraction of archive and processing of the contents, the `id` for the new compendium is returned.

        <!--HTML is necessary, due to being essential for the notes-->

        </div>

        For local testing you can quickly upload some of the example compendia and workspaces from the [erc-examples](https://github.com/o2r-project/erc-examples) project.

        ## Public share

        Load a research compendium by submitting a link to a cloud resource using an HTTP `POST` request using `multipart/form-data`.

        Currently, the following repositories are supported:

        - [Sciebo](https://sciebo.de)
        - [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org)
        - [Zenodo Sandbox](https://sandbox.zenodo.org)

        ## Common

        All repositories use the same API endpoint `https://…/api/v1/compendium`, but with different required/optional parameters.

        The upload is only allowed for logged in users.

        <div class="note blue_note">
          <p><b>&thinsp;&#x26A0; Required user level and authentication</b></p>
          <p>&thinsp;The user creating a new compendium must have the required <a href="#section/User-levels">user level</a>.
          Requests must be authenticated with a cookie `connect.sid`, see <a href="#section/User-authentication">user authentication</a>.</p>
        </div>

        To run the load from the command line, login on the website and open you browser cookies.
        Find a cookie issued by `o2r.uni-muenster.de` with the name `connect.sid`.
        Copy the contents of the cookie into the request example below.

        Upon successful download from the public share, the `id` for the new compendium is returned.

        ```bash
        curl -F "content_type=compendium" \
            -F "share_url=https://uni-muenster.sciebo.de/index.php/s/G8vxQ1h50V4HpuA"  \
            --cookie "connect.sid=<code string here>" \
             https://…/api/v1/compendium
        ```

        <div class="note yellow_note">
          <p><b>&thinsp;&#x26A0; Warning "Important"</b></p>
          <p>&thinsp;After successful load from a public share, the <a href="upload.md#candidate-process">candidate process</a> applies.</p>
        </div>

        ## Sciebo

        [Sciebo](http://www.sciebo.de/en/about/index.html) is a cloud storage service at North Rhine-Westphalian universities.
        Although it builds on ownCloud and the implementation might be able to handle any ownCloud link, only Sciebo's publish shares are supported by this API.

        ### File selection

        Depending on the public share contents different processes are triggered:

        1. If a file named `bagit.txt` is found, the directory is checked for Bagit validity
        2. If a single zip file is found, the file is extracted, if multiple zip files are found, the filename has to be specified, otherwise an error is returned
        3. If a single subdirectory is found, the reproducibility service uses that subdirectory as the base directory for loading
        4. Depending on the value of `content_type` (see below), the public share contents are treated as a complete compendium or as a  workspace

        #### Example data

        For testing purposes you can use the following public share, which contains a few ready-to-use compendia:

        [Example data](https://uni-muenster.sciebo.de/s/G8vxQ1h50V4HpuA)

        For testing purposes you can use the following public shares.
        They contain the a compendium with metadata.

      summary: Update the compendium metadata
      description: |
        The following endpoint can be used to update the `o2r` metadata elements.
        All other metadata sub-properties are only updated by the service itself, i.e. brokered metadata.
        After creation the metadata is persisted to both files and database, so updating the metadata via this endpoint allows to trigger a brokering process and to retrieve different metadata formats either via this metadata API or via downloading the respective file using the [download endpoint](#operation/download_compendium).

        <div class="note blue_note">
          <p><b>&thinsp;&#x26A0; Metadata update rights</b></p>
          <p>&thinsp; Only authors of a compendium or users with the required <a href="#section/User-levels">user level</a> can update a compendium's metadata.</p>
        </div>

        ### Metadata update request

        ```
        curl -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
          -X PUT \
          --cookie "connect.sid=<code string here>" \
          -d '{ "o2r": { "title": "Blue Book" } }' \
          /api/v1/compendium/:id/metadata
        ```
        The request overwrites the existing metadata properties, so the full o2r metadata must be put with a JSON object called `o2r` at the root, even if only specific fields are changed.

  #      The file listing is returned in the single view of a job or compendium. It includes the complete content of the compendium in its current state.
  #      If a job has been run and the programme outputs new data, this new data is included as well.

  #      File listings are represented as a Object. The file structure for a synthetic job `nj141` is as follows.

  #      ```text
  #      nj141
  #      ├── bagit.txt
  #      └── data

    #    is be represented as

    #    ```json
    #    {

    #        {

    #          "name": "bagit.xt",
    #          "type": "text/plain",
    #          "size": 55
    #        },
    #        {
    #          "path": "/api/v1/job/nj141/data/data",
    #          "name": "data",

    #          ]
    #        }
    #      ]
    #    }
    #    ```

    #    ## `path` property

    #    The `path` property for each file in the listing is a link to the raw file. Additionally the `GET` parameter `?size=…` can be appended to retrieve previews of the files. In the case of Images (`png`, `jpg`, `gif`, `tiff`), the value defines the maximum width/height. For text files (`txt`, `csv`, scripts), the value defines the amount of lines returned.

    #    ### `type` property

    #    The `type` property is a best guess for the MIME type of the file content. It is a result of the files extension. Look at the list of extension to type mapping below.

    #    ## File extension to MIME type mappings

    #    This list contains the custom mapping of file extensions to MIME types used in the server.

    #    | Extension        | MIME type          |
    #    |------------------|--------------------|
    #    | `.R`, `.r`       | `script/x-R`       |
    #    |  `.RData`, `.Rdata`, `.rdata`, `.rda`   |  `application/x-r-data`  |

    #    ## File inspection: RData

    #    `.RData` files are a [binary format](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/save.html) for usage with R to save any kind of object (data, functions) using an internal serialisation.
    #    The format is [not suitable](https://www.loc.gov/preservation/digital/formats/fdd/fdd000470.shtml) for archival or data exchange, but might be included in a compendium out of negligence by or convenience for the author.

    #    Since the file format is binary and not readable by non-R client applications, the API provides the endpoint `/api/v1/inspection` to retrieve a JSON representation of the objects in an RData file.

    #    Values of objects are provided as JSON arrays following the specifications by the R package [`jsonlite`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=jsonlite).

        #### Step metadata

        Additional explanations on steps' status will be transmitted in the `text` property.
        `text` is an array, with the latest element holding the newest information.
        During long running steps, the `text` element is updated by appending new information when available.

        The `start` and `end` timestamps indicate the start and end time of the step. They are formatted as [RFC-3339](tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339).

        Specific steps may carry more information in additional properties.

        All steps can have one of the following status:

        - `queued`: step is not yet started
        - `running`: step is currently running
        - `success`: step is completed successfully - positive result
        - `failure`: step is completed unsuccessfully - negative result
        - `skipped`: step does not fit the given input or results of previous steps, e.g. bag validation is not done for non-bag workspaces - neutral result

      description: |
        Use the _recipient_ endpoint to find out, which repositories are available and configured.
        The response is list of tuples with `id` and `label` of each repository.
        The `id` is the repository identifier to be used in requests to the `/shipment` endpoint, e.g. to define the recipient, while `label` is a human-readable text string suitable for display in user interfaces.
        An implementation may support one or more of the following repositories:

        - `b2share` - [Eudat b2share](https://b2share.eudat.eu/)
        - `b2share_sandbox` - [Eudat b2share Sandbox](https://trng-b2share.eudat.eu/)
        - `zenodo` - [Zenodo Sandbox](https://zenodo.org)
        - `zenodo_sandbox` - [Zenodo Sandbox](https://sandbox.zenodo.org)

        The `download` recipient is a surrogate to enable shipping to the user's local storage.

  #Substitution paths
  /substitution:
    description: |
      Substitution is the combination of an base compendium, "base" for short, and an overlay compendium, or "overlay".
      A user can choose files from the overlay to replace files of the base, or upload new files.
      Additionally the user can choose, if the metadata of the base ERC will be adopted for substitution (`keepBase`) or there will be a new extraction of the metadata for the substituted ERC.
      This new extraction is divided into two choices.
      The user can let the new extracted metadata be merged into the existing metadata of the base ERC (`extractAndMerge` - **not implemented**) or just save the extracted metadata (`extract` - **not implemented**).

      summary: Create substitution
      description: |
        `Create substitution` produces a new compendium with its own files in the storage and metadata in the database.
        A substitution can be created with an HTTP `POST` request using `multipart/form-data` and content-type `JSON`.
        Required content of the request are the identifiers of the base and overlay compendia and at least one pair of _substitution files_, consisting of a base file and an overlay file.

        <div class="note blue_note">
          <p><b>&thinsp;&#x26A0; Note</b></p>
          <p>&thinsp;  A substitution process removes potentially existing packaging information, i.e. if the base compendium was a BagIt bag, the substitution will only contain the payload directory contents (<code>/data</code> directory).


          The overlay file is stripped of all paths and is copied directly into the substitution's root directory.</p>

        Navigate the web browser (e.g. via a HTML `<a>` link) to `/api/v1/auth/login`, which then redirects the user and request access to your ORCID profile. After granting access, ORCID redirects the user back to the `/api/v1/auth/login` endpoint with a unique `code` param that is used to verify the request.

        If the verification was successful, the endpoint returns a session cookie named `connect.sid`, which is tied to a authenticated session. The server answers with a `302 redirect`, which redirects the user back to `/`, the start page of the o2r website.

        If the login is unsuccessful, the user is not redirected back to the site and no further redirects are configured.

        ------

        🚧 This endpoint is _not_ available on the public demo server. 🚧

        ------

        The search uses a document database to provide high speed and powerful search capabilities for compendia, including spatial and temporal properties.

        The search structure is based on [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/) and thereby eases an implementation, because the requests and responses shown here can be directly mapped to respectively from [Elasticsearch's API](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/search.html).

        **Indexed information:**

        - compendium _metadata_ (including harvested and user-edited metadata such as temporal ranges and spatial extents)
        - _full texts_ of text files in a compendium

        #### Simple search

        A simple search allows searching for search terms using an `HTTP GET` request accepting `application/json` content type.

        `curl -H 'Content-Type: application/json' https://.../api/v1/search?q=$SEARCHTERM`

        #### Example requests

        ## Complex Search

        A complex search is enabled via `POST` requests with a `JSON` payload as `HTTP POST` data (_not_ `multipart/form-data`) accepting an `application/json` content type as response.
        Queries can include filters, aggregation and spatio-temporal operations as defined in the [Elasticsearch Query DSL](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-dsl.html).

        `curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' 'https://.../api/v1/search' -d '$QUERY_DSL'`

        The **response** structure is the same as for [simple search](#operation/simple_search).

      ## Candidate process

      After uploading a compendium is _not_ instantly publicly available.
      It is merely a **candidate**, because metadata still must be completed for the compendium to be valid.
      Users with sufficient rights can create [public links](#operation/upload_link) for a candidate compendium.

      The following process models this intermediate state of a compendium.

      ### Creation and view

      Candidates can be identified by the property `candidate`.
      It is set to `true` after creating a new compendium by [upload](#operation/upload_compendium) or [public share submission](#operation/upload_compendium) **and** the authoring user having reviewed the metadata.

      <div class="note blue_note">
          <p><b>&thinsp;&#x26A0; Note</b></p>
          <p>&thinsp;It is not possible to circumvent the metadata review.
          Only a successful <a href="#operation/get_metadata">metadata update</a> can set <code>candidate: true</code>.</p>
      </div>

      **Example:**

      ```json
      {
        "id":"12345",
        "metadata": … ,
        "created": "2016-08-01T13:57:40.760Z",
        "files": …,
        "candidate": true
      }
      ```

      Only the creating user and users with [required level](#section/User-levels) can view a candidate and see the `candidate` property while it is `true`.

      When accessing a [list of compendia](#operation/list_compendium) for a specific user _as that user_, then this list is extended by available candidates.
      The candidates may be added to the response independently from any pagination settings, i.e. if a client requests the first 10 compendia for a user having two candidates, the client should be prepared to handle 12 items in the response.

      ### Metadata review and saving

      After the user has reviewed and potentially updated the metadata as required and [saved them](metadata.md#update-metadata) successfully, then the candidate status is changed (`candidate: false`) and the compendium is publicly available.

      The `candidate` property is not exposed any more if it is `false`.

      It is _not_ possible to save invalid metadata or to manually change the `candidate` property, therefore a compendium cannot become a candidate again after successful completion of the creation.

      ### Deletion

      Unlike published compendia, a candidate can be deleted by a the authoring user, see [delete compendium](#operation/delete_compendium).

  - name: Metadata
    description: |
      ### Basics

      Metadata in a compendium is stored in a directory `.erc`. This directory contains the normative metadata documents using a file naming scheme `<PREFIX>_<MODEL>_<VERSION>.<FORMAT>` filled via each metadata mapping file found in the broker tool of the o2r metadata tool suite, the default prefix is `metadata`, e.g. `metadata_o2r_1.json`, `metadata_zenodo_1.json`, or `metadata_datacite_41.xml`. The filename of the extracted raw metadata has no versioning and is constantly found as `metadata_raw.json`.

      A copy of the files in this directory is kept in database for easier access, so every compendium returned by the API can contain different sub-properties in the metadata property.
      _This API always returns the database copy of the metadata elements._
      You can download the respective files to access the normative metadata documents.

      ### Metadata formats

      The files are available on demand, but metadata variants are created after each metadata update.

      The sub-properties of the `metadata` and their content are

      - `raw` contains raw metadata extracted automatically
      - `o2r` holds the **main information for display** and is modelled according the the o2r metadata model. This metadata is reviewed by the user and the basis for translating to other metadata formats and also for [search](../search.md).
      - `zenodo` holds [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/) metadata for shipments made to Zenodo and is brokered from `o2r` metadata
      - `zenodo_sandbox` holds [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/) metadata for shipments made to Zenodo Sandbox, i.e. a clone of `zenodo` metadata

      <div class="note blue_note">
          <p><b>&thinsp;&#x26A0; Note</b></p>
          <p>&thinsp;The information in each sub-property are subject to independent workflows and may differ from one another.
          The term <b>brokering</b> is used for translation from one metadata format into another.</p>
      </div>

      ### Metadata validation

      Only valid metadata can be saved to a compendium.
      The `o2r` metadata element is validated against a [JSON Schema](http://json-schema.org/) using the `validate` tool of [`o2r-meta`](https://github.com/o2r-project/o2r-meta).
      The schema file is included in the `o2r-meta` repository: [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/o2r-project/o2r-meta/master/schema/json/o2r-meta-schema.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/o2r-project/o2r-meta/master/schema/json/o2r-meta-schema.json).

  - name: Execution
    description: |
      ## Execute a compendium

      Execution jobs are used to run the analysis in a compendium.
      When a new execution job is started, the contents of the research compendium are cloned to create a trackable execution (see [Job files](#job-files)).
      The status information, logs and final working directory data are saved in their final state, so that they can be reviewed later on.

      All execution jobs are tied to a single research compendium and reflect the execution history of that research compendium.

      A trivial execution job would be a completely unmodified compendium, to test the executability and thus basic reproducibility of the contained workflow.

      ### Job files

      All files except the following are copied to a separate storage for each job:

      - existing image tarballs, e.g. `image.tar` to reduce size of copied files and because jobs use images from the local image repository anyway
      - the [_display file_](https://o2r.info/erc-spec/spec/#main-display-file) to make sure the check does not wrongly work on the original display file

      ### Job status

      The property `job.status` shows the **overall status** of a job.

      The overall status can be one of following:

      - `success` - if status of all steps is `success`.
      - `failure` - if status of at least one step is `failure`.
      - `running` - if status of at least one step is `running` and no status is `failure`.

      More information about `steps` can be found in subsection `Steps` of section `View single job`.

      ### Steps of a job

      One job consists of a series of steps.
      The are executed in order.

      - **validate_bag**
        Validate the BagIt bag using the npm library [bagit](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bagit); may be skipped if compendium is not a bag, will usually fail because of added metadata files during upload.
      - **generate_configuration**
        Create a compendium configuration file; may be skipped if configuration file is already present.
      - **validate_compendium**
        Parses and validates the compendium configuration file.
      - **generate_manifest**
        Executes the given analysis to create a container manifest; may be skipped if manifest file is already present.
      - **image_prepare**
        Create an archive of the payload (i.e. the workspace, or the data in a BagIt bag), which allows to build and run the image also on remote hosts.
      - **image_build**
        Build an image and tag it `erc:<job_id>`.
      - **image_execute**
        Run the container and return based on status code of program that ran inside the container.
      - **check**
        Run a check on the contents of the container. Validate the results of the executed calculations. The check provides either a list of errors or a reference to displayable content in the property `display.diff`.
      - **image_save**
        Export the image to a file within the compendium directory (potentially a large file!). This is skipped if the check failed.
      - **cleanup**
        Remove image or job files (depending on server-side settings).


      ## Job status updates

      You can subscribe to real time status updates on jobs using [WebSockets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket).
      The implementation is based on [socket.io](http://socket.io) and using their client is recommended.

      The job log is available at `https://o2r.uni-muenster.de` under the namespace `api/v1/logs/job`.

      ```JavaScript
      # create a socket.io client:
      var socket = io('https://o2r.uni-muenster.de/api/v1/logs/job');
      ```

  - name: Shipment
    description: |
      ## Ship compendia and metadata

      Shipments are used to deliver compendia and their metadata to third party repositories or archives.
      This section covers shipment related requests, including repository file management.

      ### Packaging

      The packaging of a compendium ensures a recipient can verify the integrity of the transported data.
      Currently, the shipment process always creates [BagIt](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-kunze-bagit) bags to package a compendium.

  - name: Bindings
    description: |
      # Bindings

      A binding is an optional component of an Executable Research Compendium.
      It can be used to make static figures interactive, for example, to show how different parameter settings affect the result shown in the figure.
      A bindings stores information on the code lines needed to generate the corresponding figure, the parameter that should be made interactive, the data subset required for the figure, and the user interface (UI) widget (e.g. a slider or radio buttons).
      The resulting JSON object including the binding is stored in the metadata tag `interaction`.
      For this reason, the compendium must be at least a `candidate` where the metadata extraction is completed.

  - name: Users
    description: |
      ## User levels

      Users are authenticated via OAuth and the actions on the website are limited by the `level` associated with an account.
      On registration, each account is assigned a level `0`.
      Only admin users and the user herself can read the level of a user.

      The following is a list of actions and the corresponding required _minimum_ user level.

      - `0` _Users_ (everybody)
          - Create new jobs
          - View compendia, jobs, user details
      - `100` _Known users_
          - Create new compendium
          - Create shipments
          - Create substitutions
          - Delete own candidates
      - `500` _Editors_
          - Edit user levels up to own level
          - Edit compendium metadata
          - Delete candidates
          - Manage [public links](#operation/upload_link) for candidates
      - `1000` _Admins_
          - Edit user levels up to own level
          - Delete compendia and candidates
          - View status pages of microservices

      ##  User authentication

      User authentication is done via authenticated sessions, which are referenced with a cookie called `connect.sid`. For every endpoint that needs user authentication, a cookie with an authenticated session is required.

      ### Client authentication

      To execute restricted operations of the API, such as [compendium upload]() or [job execution](), a client must provide an authentication token via a cookie.

      A client must first login on the website to access a browser cookie issued by `o2r.uni-muenster.de` with the name `connect.sid`.
      Provide the content of the cookie when making requests to the API as shown in the request example below.

      ### Access authentication information for direct API access

      To run commands which require authentication from the command line, a user must login on the website first.
      Then open you browser cookies and find a cookie issued by `o2r.uni-muenster.de` with the name `connect.sid`.
      Use the the contents of the cookie for your requests, for example as shown below when using curl.

      ```bash
      curl [...] --cookie "connect.sid=<code string here>" \
           https://…/api/v1/endpoint
      ```

      ### Authentication within microservices

      **Attention:** The authentication process _requires_ a secured connection, i.e. `HTTPS`.

      ### Authentication provider

      Session authentication is done using the OAuth 2.0 protocol.
      Currently [ORCID](https://www.orcid.org) is the only available authentication provider, therefore users need to be registered with ORCID. Because of its nature, the authentication workflow is not a RESTful service.
      Users must follow the redirection to the login endpoint with their web browser and grant access to the o2r reproducibility service for their ORCID account.
      They are then sent back to our authentication service, which verifies the authentication request and enriches the user session with the verified ORCID for this user.
